If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","threat":["A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service, or gain root privileges.","A local attacker could exploit this to cause a kernel oops.","A local attacker able to mount ext3 or ext4 file systems could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.","A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system."],"update":{"10.04":[{"version":"2.6.35-31.63~lucid1","package":"linux-image-2.6.35-31-generic"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.35-31-generic-pae","version":"2.6.35-31.63~lucid1"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.35-31-server","version":"2.6.35-31.63~lucid1"},{"version":"2.6.35-31.63~lucid1","package":"linux-image-2.6.35-31-virtual"}]}}
