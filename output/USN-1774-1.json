If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","usn":"USN-1774-1","date":"March 21, 2013","info":"linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities","threat":null,"CVEs":["CVE-2013-0190","CVE-2013-0216","CVE-2013-0217","CVE-2013-0231","CVE-2013-0290","CVE-2013-0311"]}
