If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","threat":["A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system or possibly execute arbitrary code as the root user.","A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system or possibly execute arbitrary code as the root user.","A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.","A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.","A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.","A local attacker could exploit this to cause the kernel to hang, leading to a denial of service.","A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.","A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.","A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.","A local attacker on a 64bit system could exploit this to crash the kernel, leading to a denial of service.","If a system was using X.25, a remote attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.","A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.","If a local attacker were able to trigger certain kinds of kernel bugs, they could create a specially crafted process to gain root privileges.","A local attacker could send specially crafted traffic to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.","A local attacker could exploit this to mmap 4096 bytes below the mmap_min_addr area, possibly improving the chances of performing NULL pointer dereference attacks.","A local attacker could exploit this crash the system or gain root privileges.","On non-x86 systems, a local attacker could exploit this to read kernel heap memory, leading to a loss of privacy.","A local attacker could use this to increase the chances of a successful memory corruption exploit.","A local attacker with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges could exploit this to read portions of kernel heap memory, leading to a loss of privacy.","A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to crash the system or potentially gain root privileges.","A local attacker could exploit this to read uninitialized data from the disk, leading to a loss of privacy.","If the dvb-ttpci module was loaded, a local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service, or possibly gain root privileges.","On systems using InfiniBand, a local attacker could send specially crafted requests to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.","A local attacker could make crafted ioctl calls to leak portions of kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.","A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to crash the system or potentially gain root privileges.","By inserting a specially crafted disk device, a local attacker could exploit this to gain root privileges.","A local attacker could exploit this to send signals to arbitrary threads, possibly bypassing expected restrictions.","If these drivers were loaded, a local attacker could exploit this to read arbitrary kernel memory, leading to a loss of privacy.","A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.","A local attacker with access to the video subsystem could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service, or possibly gain root privileges.","A local attacker with access to the video subsystem could exploit this to run the system out of memory, leading to a denial of service.","If this driver was loaded, a local attacker could crash the system, leading to a denial of service."],"usn":"USN-1164-1","CVEs":["CVE-2010-3865","CVE-2010-3874","CVE-2010-3875","CVE-2010-3876","CVE-2010-3877","CVE-2010-3880","CVE-2010-4080","CVE-2010-4081","CVE-2010-4082","CVE-2010-4083","CVE-2010-4157","CVE-2010-4164","CVE-2010-4248","CVE-2010-4258","CVE-2010-4342","CVE-2010-4346","CVE-2010-4527","CVE-2010-4529","CVE-2010-4565","CVE-2010-4655","CVE-2010-4656","CVE-2011-0463","CVE-2011-0521","CVE-2011-0695","CVE-2011-0711","CVE-2011-0712","CVE-2011-1017","CVE-2011-1182","CVE-2011-1494","CVE-2011-1495","CVE-2011-1593","CVE-2011-1745","CVE-2011-1746","CVE-2011-1747","CVE-2011-1748","CVE-2011-2022"],"info":"linux-fsl-imx51 vulnerabilities","date":"July 06, 2011"}
