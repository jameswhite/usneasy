If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","threat":["A local attacker could exploit this race by using chown on a setuid-user-binary to gain administrative privileges.."],"update":{"14.10":[{"package":"linux-image-3.16.0-37-generic","version":"3.16.0-37.49"},{"version":"3.16.0-37.49","package":"linux-image-3.16.0-37-generic-lpae"},{"version":"3.16.0-37.49","package":"linux-image-3.16.0-37-lowlatency"},{"package":"linux-image-3.16.0-37-powerpc-e500mc","version":"3.16.0-37.49"},{"version":"3.16.0-37.49","package":"linux-image-3.16.0-37-powerpc-smp"},{"version":"3.16.0-37.49","package":"linux-image-3.16.0-37-powerpc64-emb"},{"package":"linux-image-3.16.0-37-powerpc64-smp","version":"3.16.0-37.49"}]},"date":"May 05, 2015","usn":"USN-2600-1","CVEs":["CVE-2015-3339"],"info":"linux vulnerability"}
