If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","update":{"12.04":[{"package":"linux-image-3.13.0-40-generic","version":"3.13.0-40.69~precise1"},{"package":"linux-image-3.13.0-40-generic-lpae","version":"3.13.0-40.69~precise1"}]}}
