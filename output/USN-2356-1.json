If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","update":{"12.04":[{"version":"3.2.0-69.103","package":"linux-image-3.2.0-69-generic"},{"package":"linux-image-3.2.0-69-generic-pae","version":"3.2.0-69.103"},{"package":"linux-image-3.2.0-69-highbank","version":"3.2.0-69.103"},{"package":"linux-image-3.2.0-69-omap","version":"3.2.0-69.103"},{"package":"linux-image-3.2.0-69-powerpc-smp","version":"3.2.0-69.103"},{"version":"3.2.0-69.103","package":"linux-image-3.2.0-69-powerpc64-smp"},{"package":"linux-image-3.2.0-69-virtual","version":"3.2.0-69.103"}]}}
