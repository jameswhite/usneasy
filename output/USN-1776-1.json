If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","update":{"10.04":[{"version":"2.6.32-351.62","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-351-ec2"}]},"usn":"USN-1776-1","threat":null,"date":"March 22, 2013","info":"linux-ec2 vulnerabilities","CVEs":["CVE-2013-0268","CVE-2013-0309","CVE-2013-1773"]}
