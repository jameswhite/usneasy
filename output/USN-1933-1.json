If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","threat":["A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash)."],"update":{"12.10":[{"version":"3.5.0-231.47","package":"linux-image-3.5.0-231-omap4"}]},"date":"August 20, 2013","usn":"USN-1933-1","CVEs":["CVE-2013-1059","CVE-2013-2148","CVE-2013-2164","CVE-2013-2851"],"info":"linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities"}
