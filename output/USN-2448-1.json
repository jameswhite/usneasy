If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","update":{"14.10":[{"version":"3.16.0-28.37","package":"linux-image-3.16.0-28-generic"},{"version":"3.16.0-28.37","package":"linux-image-3.16.0-28-generic-lpae"},{"package":"linux-image-3.16.0-28-lowlatency","version":"3.16.0-28.37"},{"version":"3.16.0-28.37","package":"linux-image-3.16.0-28-powerpc-e500mc"},{"version":"3.16.0-28.37","package":"linux-image-3.16.0-28-powerpc-smp"},{"package":"linux-image-3.16.0-28-powerpc64-emb","version":"3.16.0-28.37"},{"package":"linux-image-3.16.0-28-powerpc64-smp","version":"3.16.0-28.37"}]}}
