If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","threat":["A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel crash) or to potentially execute code with kernel privileges.","An unprivileged attacker on a local network could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (IPv6 messages dropped)."],"update":{"14.04":[{"package":"linux-image-3.13.0-51-generic","version":"3.13.0-51.84"},{"version":"3.13.0-51.84","package":"linux-image-3.13.0-51-generic-lpae"},{"package":"linux-image-3.13.0-51-lowlatency","version":"3.13.0-51.84"},{"package":"linux-image-3.13.0-51-powerpc-e500","version":"3.13.0-51.84"},{"package":"linux-image-3.13.0-51-powerpc-e500mc","version":"3.13.0-51.84"},{"package":"linux-image-3.13.0-51-powerpc-smp","version":"3.13.0-51.84"},{"version":"3.13.0-51.84","package":"linux-image-3.13.0-51-powerpc64-emb"},{"package":"linux-image-3.13.0-51-powerpc64-smp","version":"3.13.0-51.84"}]}}
