If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","update":{"11.10":[{"package":"linux-image-3.0.0-22-generic","version":"3.0.0-22.36"},{"version":"3.0.0-22.36","package":"linux-image-3.0.0-22-generic-pae"},{"package":"linux-image-3.0.0-22-omap","version":"3.0.0-22.36"},{"version":"3.0.0-22.36","package":"linux-image-3.0.0-22-powerpc"},{"package":"linux-image-3.0.0-22-powerpc-smp","version":"3.0.0-22.36"},{"package":"linux-image-3.0.0-22-powerpc64-smp","version":"3.0.0-22.36"},{"version":"3.0.0-22.36","package":"linux-image-3.0.0-22-server"},{"version":"3.0.0-22.36","package":"linux-image-3.0.0-22-virtual"}]}}
