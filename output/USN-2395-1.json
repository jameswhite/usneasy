If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","update":{"14.04":[{"package":"linux-image-3.13.0-39-generic","version":"3.13.0-39.66"},{"version":"3.13.0-39.66","package":"linux-image-3.13.0-39-generic-lpae"},{"version":"3.13.0-39.66","package":"linux-image-3.13.0-39-lowlatency"},{"version":"3.13.0-39.66","package":"linux-image-3.13.0-39-powerpc-e500"},{"version":"3.13.0-39.66","package":"linux-image-3.13.0-39-powerpc-e500mc"},{"package":"linux-image-3.13.0-39-powerpc-smp","version":"3.13.0-39.66"},{"package":"linux-image-3.13.0-39-powerpc64-emb","version":"3.13.0-39.66"},{"package":"linux-image-3.13.0-39-powerpc64-smp","version":"3.13.0-39.66"}]},"date":"October 30, 2014"}
