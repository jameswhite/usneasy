If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","update":{"12.04":[{"version":"3.2.0-31.50","package":"linux-image-3.2.0-31-generic"},{"package":"linux-image-3.2.0-31-generic-pae","version":"3.2.0-31.50"},{"version":"3.2.0-31.50","package":"linux-image-3.2.0-31-highbank"},{"package":"linux-image-3.2.0-31-omap","version":"3.2.0-31.50"},{"version":"3.2.0-31.50","package":"linux-image-3.2.0-31-powerpc-smp"},{"version":"3.2.0-31.50","package":"linux-image-3.2.0-31-powerpc64-smp"},{"version":"3.2.0-31.50","package":"linux-image-3.2.0-31-virtual"}]},"date":"September 21, 2012"}
