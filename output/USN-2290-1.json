{"special":"The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:\nAfter a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make\nall the necessary changes.\nATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have\nbeen given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and\nreinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","threat":["A local attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.","An attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or OOPS).","An attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly other unspecified impact."],"update":{"14.04":[{"version":"3.13.0-32.57","package":"linux-image-3.13.0-32-generic"},{"package":"linux-image-3.13.0-32-generic-lpae","version":"3.13.0-32.57"},{"package":"linux-image-3.13.0-32-lowlatency","version":"3.13.0-32.57"},{"version":"3.13.0-32.57","package":"linux-image-3.13.0-32-powerpc-e500"},{"package":"linux-image-3.13.0-32-powerpc-e500mc","version":"3.13.0-32.57"},{"package":"linux-image-3.13.0-32-powerpc-smp","version":"3.13.0-32.57"},{"version":"3.13.0-32.57","package":"linux-image-3.13.0-32-powerpc64-emb"},{"package":"linux-image-3.13.0-32-powerpc64-smp","version":"3.13.0-32.57"}]},"date":"July 17, 2014","usn":"USN-2290-1","CVEs":["CVE-2014-1739","CVE-2014-3144","CVE-2014-3145","CVE-2014-3940","CVE-2014-4608","CVE-2014-4611","CVE-2014-4943"],"info":"linux vulnerabilities"}
