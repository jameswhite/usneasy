If\nyou use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as\nwell to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you\nmanually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,\nlinux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically\nperform this as well.","update":{"10.04":[{"version":"2.6.32-38.83","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-38-386"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-38-generic","version":"2.6.32-38.83"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-38-generic-pae","version":"2.6.32-38.83"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-38-ia64","version":"2.6.32-38.83"},{"version":"2.6.32-38.83","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-38-lpia"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-38-powerpc","version":"2.6.32-38.83"},{"version":"2.6.32-38.83","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-38-powerpc-smp"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-38-powerpc64-smp","version":"2.6.32-38.83"},{"version":"2.6.32-38.83","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-38-preempt"},{"version":"2.6.32-38.83","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-38-server"},{"version":"2.6.32-38.83","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-38-sparc64"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-38-sparc64-smp","version":"2.6.32-38.83"},{"package":"linux-image-2.6.32-38-versatile","version":"2.6.32-38.83"},{"version":"2.6.32-38.83","package":"linux-image-2.6.32-38-virtual"}]}}
